This was a challenging task. A particular challenge for me was to keep track of variables used to describe arrays versus outcomes of prompts.
The process that the code was supposed to follow was quite convoluted so I found that confusing at times.
I ended up re-writing the whole thing before I'd finished.
I certainly benefitted from a lot of help from classmates!
Please look below for my attached screenshots. Thanks for your assessment!
